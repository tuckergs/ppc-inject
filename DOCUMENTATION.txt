Usage:
You run ./PPCInject [input file name] [file name to output to] [one or more assembly files]

Terminology:
A ``function'' is a snippet of code. It need not be an actual function. 
You could use it to replace a few lines of code, or a whole function
I got this convention from Star Rod, the epic Paper Mario tool

Format of assembly files:
An assembly file is made up of one or more functions. 

To start a function, you write a line like: 
#function [function label] [offset] (optionally maxSize [max size])
A function label must start with a dollar sign, like $betta
A offset can either be a unsigned offset or "after [function label]"
When you use "after $betta", you are saying that you want to have a function placed after the code for function $betta
You could optionally put "maxSize [size]" at the end, which makes sure that you don't write more code the max size you specify allows

After that, for the body of the function, each line either specifies a local label or an instruction
A local label must start with a period, like .bagel
You would write an instruction just like the PowerPC documentation tells you to.
There are some shortcuts like andi instead of andi. , and cmpw r2,r1 instead of cmpw cr0,r2,r1
Note that Dolphin's convention of adding +/- to the end of conditional branches instruction names is NOT supported.

To end a function, just start another function with the #function line. The end of the file also ends a function 

Throughout, you could use the percent sign to specify line comments

You may also specify global offsets by using "#offset [offset label] [offset]". These let you specify out of file offsets
An offset label must start with an '@'

IMPORTANT: Any offset that you specify is relative to how far we are from the beginning of the file.
For example, if we want to replace function at RAM address 0x803133cc and the file is loaded at 0x80270100, the offset we want is 803133cc-80270100 = a32cc
Keep this in mind also when specify out-of-file addresses using #offset
The number system defaults to decimal so be sure to use "0x" when specify hexadecimal
